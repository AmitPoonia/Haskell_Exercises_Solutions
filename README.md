This repository contains homework exercises solutions for the introductory Haskell course taught at
UPenn. I am starting with 1st homework and hopefully keep adding rest of solutions
as I progress with course material.


I am a beginner with Haskell as well as with Functional Programming so the solutions might not be perfect 
or most optimal and kept as simple as the lecture material instructs it to be, any issues or bug reporting would be helpful. 


The course assignments and lecture material can be accessed with below link:
